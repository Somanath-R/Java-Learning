Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

Key features of Java:
- Object-Oriented: Everything is an object in Java.
- Platform-Independent: Java code can run on any platform that has a JVM.
- Simple and Familiar: Java is designed to be easy to learn and use.
- Secure: Java has built-in security features to protect against malicious code.
- Robust: Java has strong memory management and exception handling features.
- Multithreaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads.
- High Performance: Java's performance is enhanced through the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.

Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), web applications, and more.
